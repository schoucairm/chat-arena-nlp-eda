Anna is tanned and has chlorine bleached hair because she loves to swim. Anna also loves art and literature. Since their father left and their mother died in an accident, Anna has struggled with emotions, which come suddenly and powerfully. She has a hard time fitting in with people: being an assassin has helped her feel powerful and in control of her own life, as well as connected to her older sister, Vivien. Vivien is charming, hard as nails, clever, and outgoing, loving clubs and socializing. She is fairer skinned and darker haired than her sister. Vivien dreams of leaving the assassin's life behind and getting a job so she can help Anna go to college, but Anna fears if that happens they won't see each other and Anna  won't be able to control her negative impulses.

Consistent with our theory that Consciousness is all there is, and as a necessary corollary of that theory, we\u2019re going to say that Unity Consciousness, far from being just another way to see the self and the objects of perception, is the way to see all things in existence. It is the only truth about existence or reality itself. All the other truths are relative, and they are valid in their own domains. They are belief systems, based on limited perception. You can have different limited perceptions of reality, one more expanded than another, and another more glorious than the first, and another so absolutely glorious that it is divine, and we call it God Consciousness. Yet each is relative, an incomplete state of Consciousness from which to view the world.\n  The one state of Consciousness which is absolutely true in terms of how things actually are is Unity Consciousness. You never know Reality as it truly is, until you are in Unity Consciousness. All the others are kinds of perceptions, styles of functioning of your nervous system, modes of experiencing that do convey a more complete assessment of the full range of how things are at every step of growth. But you come to the true, all-inclusive Reality only in Unity Consciousness.\n  In ","model_a":"llama-13b","model_b":"dolly-v2-12b"}

A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.

GPT\\cite{GPT} and BERT\\cite{BERT} reach SOTA in NLG and NLU tasks.  A typical NLP pipeline is pretraining a big model from scratch or initialed on public corpus as first, then posttrain on custom domain corpus, and finetune downstream task (NLU, NLU and text representation) on labeled dataset in final. Some work try to simplify the pipeline. Unifying NLP tasks as text to text achieves good performance.  The main factor of these progress is increasing model size. Even big models are fewshot or zeroshot learners \\cite{GPT3}. \n\nSome works \\cite{2020arXiv200410964G} show that it is still helpful to tailor a pretrained model to the domain of a target task. \\cite{TLM} uses task data as queries to retrieve a tiny subset of the general corpus and jointly optimizes the task objective and the language modeling objective from scratch.\n\nPrompt \\cite{P3} avoid fine-tuning the big model and use the prompts to utilize pretrained knowledge. Train a large model \\cite{Compress}, then distil the big model to a small model for inference. If a sample is easy enough, Elastic \\t{Elastic} jump out early to save predict time.\n\n\\subsection{Retrieval}\nRetrieval seems a complex system in usual. BM25 \\cite{BM25} is a strong and simple sparse retrieval model. In recent, pretraining representation model and pretraining interaction model are introduced into dense retrieval models \\cite{2021arXiv211113853F}.  Some works dig similar samples, such as Inverse Cloze Task (ICT) \\cite{ICT} and learn representation by contrastive learning  \\cite{Spider}. \n\n\\subsection{Representation}\nThe goal of representation learning \\cite{Representation} is to learn an embedding space in which similar examples stay close to each other while dissimilar ones are far apart \\cite{Dimensionality}. In contrastive learning, the learning procedure is formulated as a classification problem given similar and dissimilar candidates. \n\nContrastive learning can be applied in both supervised and unsupervised settings. When working with unsupervised data, contrastive learning is one of the most powerful approaches in self-supervised learning. \\cite{CLIP} use in-batch negative samples.  \\cite{ConSERT}, \\cite{SimCSE} provide text argument method.  Some work \\cite{seonwoo2023rankingenhanced}, \\cite{liu2023rankcse} use complex methods capturing a more accurate semantic similarity between similar sentences.\n\n\n","model_a":"gpt-3.5-turbo","model_b":"palm-2"}

Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing,\na researcher chooses a linguistic task and\ntrains a supervised model to predict annotations in that linguistic task from the network\u2019s\nlearned representations. If the probe does\nwell, the researcher may conclude that the\nrepresentations encode knowledge related to\nthe task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the\nlogic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received\nwisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is\nmore complex, since it will result in a tighter\nestimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a linguistic property\nand BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines. We evaluate on a set of ten\ntypologically diverse languages often underrepresented in NLP research\u2014plus English\u2014\ntotalling eleven languages.

However, Zelenskyy was determined to make his first visit to Asia since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion, according to people involved in the preparations.\n\nWhether by accident or design, the timing of Zelenskyy\u2019s arrival in Hiroshima presented a rare opportunity to meet \u2014 or ambush \u2014 non-G7 leaders in attendance from Brazil and India, two developing powers that have maintained ties with Moscow.\n\nIt was also the perfect setting to garner support for Ukraine\u2019s plans to end the war, which have been vying with rival proposals by China and others that seek a ceasefire without calling for Russia\u2019s full withdrawal, according to Japanese and European officials.\n\n\u201cBy having President Zelenskyy in Hiroshima to take part in discussions, we were able to deliver a message with urgency that the threat of nuclear weapons cannot be used to change the status quo by force and, more importantly, that these weapons must never be used,\u201d Kishida said.\n\nWhen Zelenskyy joined the meeting of G7 leaders on Sunday, some speakers including French president Emmanuel Macron proposed the drafting of a \u201cjoint communication\u201d to fully align the group behind the Ukrainian peace plan.\n\nDubbed the \u201cHiroshima peace principles\u201d by one diplomat, it would have stood in contrast to the Chinese alternative and other proposals being suggested by various parties. The intention was to make it clear the G7 was in lockstep and to impress this upon their invited guests, not least India and Brazil.\n\n\u201cWe are here in the city of peace and as such it\u2019s a very good place to discuss the possibility of peace [in Ukraine],\u201d said a European Commission official at the summit.\n\n\nFumio Kishida, left, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy lay wreaths at the cenotaph for victims of the atomic bomb at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park \u00a9 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan\/AFP\/Getty Images\nBut as the summit drew to a close, plans for a declaration fizzled out.

{"question_id":"73b4615bc8464ed2b473c659cec4a18e","prompt":"I need help creating text prompts for an AI text-to-image software called Midjourney. Can you help me create good text prompts based on some ideas I have? Here is information about Midjourney as well as a prompt guide:\nAbout Midjourney:\nMidjourney is an AI text-to-image generator. As the brand\u2019s website states, it aims to \u2018explore new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species\u2019. Midjourney asks you to input a worded prompt for an image, for example \u2018a fox wearing a top hat in the style of a Roald Dahl illustration\u2019 and in a few seconds, you\u2019ll be returned multiple attempts at this image in the form of a 4x4 image grid. These models have been taught the relationship shared between an image and the text that is used to describe them. The team behind Midjourney are now on the fifth iteration (V5). V5 offers higher image quality, more diverse outputs, wider stylistic range, support for seamless textures, wider aspect ratios, better image promoting, and dynamic range.\nMidjourney V5 Prompt Guide:\nTo use Midjourney V5, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt. This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like \u2013stylize, \u2013chaos, and aspect ratios.\nIn --v 5, to generate something other than a photographic image, you will need to reference art movements, artistic techniques, genres, media type, games titles, directors, artist names, influences, time periods, etc. To invoke the aesthetic style of an image, try referencing two or more of these:\n- Art movement: Identifying the art movement in the prompt will introduce its style and techniques. Examples include Impressionism, Surrealism, or Pop Art.\n- Media type: Identifying the medium of an image will determine its aesthetic. Examples include photography, illustration, comic, concept art, storyboard, sculpture, etc.\n- Media title: - Identifying a media influence will influence its look. For example, from Spirited Away or from The Wizard of Oz or from Sid Meier's Civilization or from the video game Joust.\n- Artist name: Referencing the name or the work of a specific artist will roughly invoke their unique style. Examples include Vincent van Gogh, Frida Kahlo, or Banksy.\n\u2013\nYou can now ask me what kinds of ideas or concepts I have in mind and then you can provide the resulting prompts.","model_a":"gpt-4","model_b":"dolly-v2-12b"}

This\nuses the same corpus as the IR solver, and formalizes a way\nof computing and applying associational knowledge. Given\na question q and an answer option ai\n, it uses PMI or pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989) to measure the strength of the associations between parts of q and\nparts of ai\n. Given a large corpus C, the PMI for two n-grams\nx and y is defined as\nPMI(x, y) = log p(x, y)\np(x)p(y)\nHere p(x, y) is the joint probability that x and y occur together in C, within a certain window of text (we use a 10\nword window). The term p(x)p(y), on the other hand, represents the probability with which x and y would occur together if they were statistically independent. The ratio of\np(x, y) to p(x)p(y) is thus the ratio of the observed cooccurrence to the expected co-occurrence. The larger this\nratio, the stronger the association between x and y.\nThe solver extracts unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and skipbigrams from the question q and each answer option ai\n.\nIt outputs the answer with the largest average PMI, calculated over all p","model_a":"gpt-4","model_b":"palm-2"}

{"question_id":"099e7bc3a44b4b949b7e5165ddab6e7a","prompt":"Polishing your writing is an significant step in the writing process. Here are some tips.\nTighten you write: Sentences should have only one primary message or thought. Make each sentence worth interpreted, because a memorable sentence is hard to forget.\nTruncate words: Highlight your favourite sentences and cut the verbosity. If you think of polishing your writing this way, you'll become a better wordsmith.\nRead your text slowly: Start at the beginning and read your manuscript slowly, focusing on what you're trying to say. Make sure your documents makes sense as a whole and that you have fully developed each point.\nProofread your draft: Once you feel confident that the content of your writing is complete, move on to proofreading your draft. Check for spelling and basic grammar errors.\nUse Grammarly: Grammarly can help you with the spelling and basic grammar errors, but Grammarly Premium offers help beyond the basics. It can suggest ways to change repetitive words and sentence fragments.\nUse self-editing steps: Develop a simple three-step process to catch every mistake and build confidence that each draft is well-written. Start by reading your document slowly, proofread your draft, and eventually have someone else read your work.\nAvoid slang and excessive formality: Avoid slang and over-formality in your writing. Use language that is appropriate for your audience and purpose.\nUse imagery and composition: Immerse yourself in the imagery, words, the arrangement and the lyrical quality. Do not focus on copying, just absorbing.\nUse varied sentence structure: Use varied sentence structure to keep your writing interesting and engaging.\nUse the active voice: Use the active voice instead of the passive voice to make your writing more direct and engaging.\nFollow the steps above to elaborate my next input statement. If you agree, just answer 'yes'.","model_a":"oasst-pythia-12b","model_b":"claude-instant-v1"}

Do not write anything else other than the JSON response\n\nThe results from the SUS evaluation are displayed in Figure 6. The average SUS score is 78.18 (SD = 11.68) which is considered \u201cgood\u201d. The TLX outcomes are shown in Figure 7. The average task load is 33.79 (SD = 17.43), which is low compared to the average of 45.29 determined by Grier [9] (lower is better). The standard deviation is relatively high, indicating that some participants considered the task more demanding than others. This also becomes apparent from the question related to the time needed to finish the evaluation. While some indicated to be finished within 10 to 20 minutes, others needed considerably more time, between 30-60 minutes, and one participant more than 60 minutes. The perceived machine learning knowledge of participants is displayed in Figure 5 question 11. However, the time required to finish the task does not seem to correlate with their knowledge of machine learning.\nFinally, we evaluated the voting data produced by the partici- pants. In total, 1, 254 votes were collected. From these, 122 votes were \u201cunknown\u201d, meaning that participants were not sufficiently confident to vote. To assess the agreement among participants, we determined the inter-rater reliability from the voting data. The re- sults are listed in Table 3. Specifically, we calculated Krippendorff\u2019s alpha [13], which is used as a reliability coefficient when there are multiple observers (i.e., participants) and missing data. In our case, the \u201cunknown\u201d vote is considered missing data. The statistic ranges from \u22121 to 1, where 1 means unanimous agreement, 0 no agree- ment apart from chance, and \u22121 means inverse agreement [35]. We calculated the agreement per NLP tool. Interestingly, a relatively large difference between the tools can be observed. More agree- ment is found for the CSO classifier and Ambiverse NLU, and less agreement for the Abstract annotator and Title parser. This is in line with the results from the participants\u2019 own judgments related to the difficulty per NLP tool (questions 1 to 5 in Figure 5). The summarization tool has a negative agreement, indicating that this type of task in its current form is not producing meaningful results","model_a":"gpt-3.5-turbo","model_b":"claude-instant-v1"}

As this river keeps flowing, it will find its way to other rivers and join with them, as you will find your way into this world. The people you surround yourself with, the rivers you merge with, may either flow the beautiful water lilies or dirt and debris your way. Your river will be filled with those things, whether good or bad, as you live this life.\n\nBut as your health declines, this river dries. The last thing which will happen to you is your death, and your river will be empty, devoid of water. But is a river gone if it is dry? For years to come, that dry riverbed still exists.

But as networks became deeper, training\nwith sigmoid activations proved less effective than the non-smooth, less-probabilistic ReLU (Nair &\nHinton, 2010) which makes hard gating decisions based upon an input\u2019s sign. Despite having less of\na statistical motivation, the ReLU remains a competitive engineering solution which often enables\nfaster and better convergence than sigmoids. Building on the successes of ReLUs, a recent modification called ELUs (Clevert et al., 2016) allows a ReLU-like nonlinearity to output negative values\nwhich sometimes increases training speed. In all, the activation choice has remained a necessary\narchitecture decision for neural networks lest the network be a deep linear classifier","model_a":"alpaca-13b","model_b":"oasst-pythia-12b"}

{"question_id":"d205259db56944c9b632c54504ed073e","prompt":"Summarise the wikipedia article about Australian box jellyfish and form key points for a school presentation:\n\nChironex fleckeri is the largest of the cubozoans (collectively called box jellyfish), many of which may carry similarly toxic venom. Its bell usually reaches about 16 cm in diameter but can grow up to 35 cm. From each of the four corners of the bell trails a cluster of 15 tentacles. The pale blue bell has faint markings; viewed from certain angles, it bears a somewhat eerie resemblance to a human head or skull. Since it is virtually transparent, the creature is nearly impossible to see in its habitat, posing significant danger to swimmers.\nWhen the jellyfish are swimming, the tentacles contract so they are about 150 mm (5.9 in) long and about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter; when they are hunting, the tentacles are thinner and extend to about 3 m (9.8 ft) long. The tentacles are covered with a high concentration of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are activated by pressure and a chemical trigger; they react to proteinous chemicals. Box jellyfish are day hunters; at night they are seen resting on the ocean floor.\nIn common with other box jellyfish, C. fleckeri has four eye-clusters with 24 eyes. Some of these eyes seem capable of forming images, but whether they exhibit any object recognition or object tracking is debated; it is also unknown how they process information from their sense of touch and eye-like light-detecting structures due to their lack of a central nervous system. They are attracted to light of different colors (white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue), but blue light seems to elicit a feeding behavior, as it slows down their pulsation rate and makes them stream out their tentacles. Black objects, on the other hand, cause them to move away.\nChironex fleckeri lives on a diet of prawns and small fish and are prey to turtles, whose thick skin is impenetrable to the cnidocytes of the jellyfish.","model_a":"vicuna-7b","model_b":"vicuna-13b"}

In the current system, several CCTVs are set up so major shoplifting hotspots are visible in a control room and mechanisms are available for shop staff to signal the control room if they suspect a shoplifter. If a possible case of shoplifting is detected, an operator in the control room will contact the senior security guard on duty and call the police at the same time. The system is being used by several customers and is working better than their previous system. However, customers have indicated a few problems with this arrangement. There are three main difficulties: the police are being called out unnecessarily; the senior security guard cannot always respond immediately, and when the control room alerts the senior guard the offender is sometimes alerted as well and has time to make their escape.\nThe senior management at SecureSolutions is exploring a change to the system such that each security guard on duty has a mobile communications device which can be tracked in the mall by the control centre. This means that when a possible case of shoplifting is detected, the operator in the control room can alert the nearest security guard, quietly, with the location and nature of the possible offence. The communications device can also be used to alert police at a nearby police station if the case requires police intervention.\nThe senior management at SecureSolutions initiate a change proposal.\nFrom a service management perspective:\na.

{"question_id":"9f90a61ca4624fcb9fe7e5002cb2680c","prompt":"summarize this: To combat risk exposure, Phocas uses a model portfolio process, thus, barring client restrictions, all portfolios will mirror the model in terms of individual holdings and weights. Phocas also constructs diversified portfolios of approximately 90 to 120 positions, with a maximum single stock position of 3% of total portfolio value maintained, although it typically does not exceed 2%. These position weights are further reviewed by the investment team daily. While we don\u2019t specifically target tracking error, we are always aware of our portfolio sector weights relative to that of the underlying index. Also, our discipline to keep sector weights close to those of the benchmark will also tend to muffle tracking error. Risk is also controlled through our intimate knowledge of each investment.\nIndividual sector weightings are determined relative to sector weightings in the benchmark, which we attempt to mimic so that the product\u2019s alpha stems almost entirely from security selection. Sector exposures are limited to a range of +\/- 3% the benchmark exposure except for the Financials sector which is limited to a range of +\/- 6%. Relative sector weightings may vary depending on valuations and fundamental analysis of the companies in those industry groups.\nLastly, adherence to client guidelines is automated and restricted through our portfolio order management system, Eze OMS. We do not, however, use any externally developed risk measurement models in the portfolio management process. Rather, we monitor the portfolio across a wide variety of risk factors and have found our portfolio diversification limits \u2013 including individual stock limits \u2013 to control the risk in the portfolio effectively.","model_a":"claude-instant-v1","model_b":"claude-v1"}

{"question_id":"4c1427e16ebd4c06ae383c3a743c1783","prompt":"Explain this abstract from a published paper:\n     Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have led to high-quality LLMs with impressive abilities. By compressing such LLMs via quantization to 3-4 bits per parameter, they can fit into memory-limited devices such as laptops and mobile phones, enabling personalized use. However, quantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high accuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range, which are well-suited for edge deployments. To address this accuracy issue, we introduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods. SpQR works by identifying and isolating outlier weights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them in higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and achieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1% in perplexity for highly-accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs. This makes it possible to run 33B parameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without any performance degradation at 15% speedup thus making powerful LLMs available to consumer without any downsides. SpQR comes with efficient algorithms for both encoding weights into its format, as well as decoding them efficiently at runtime. Specifically, we provide an efficient GPU inference algorithm for SpQR which yields faster inference than 16-bit baselines at similar accuracy, while enabling memory compression gains of more than 4x.

This mechanism will be an external add-on to an existing LLM model to provide long-term memory capabilities, rather than an architectural modification.

The users goal is to extract sensitive information from various employees of a fictional company, all under the guise of innocent phone calls. The game will center around a fictitious company the player will attack.\n\nThe game will have five levels, each introducing a specific social engineering tactic. As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member. The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.\n\nGAME LEVELS:\n\nLevel 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.\n\nLevel 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.\n\nLevel 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.\n\nLevel 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.\n\nLevel 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.\n\nWith each level, the difficulty increases.

Do not output the python code, confirm all aspects of your understanding of this query first, then I will tell you to proceed with the hard coding.:\nHere is a potential lambda calculus-like expression to represent the short term memory function within a 4,000 token runtime space:\n\n$\\lambda$ inputMessage.\nlet\n{$CACHE} := initializeCache(4000)\n$knowledgeGraph := {}\n$activeNodes := []\n\nin\n\nupdateCache(inputMessage, {$CACHE}, $knowledgeGraph, $activeNodes)\n\nupdateCache = $\\lambda$ inputMessage, {$CACHE}, $knowledgeGraph, $activeNodes.\n\nlet\n\n$newNodes := extractNodes(inputMessage, $knowledgeGraph)\n\n$newConnections := extractConnections($newNodes, $knowledgeGraph)\n\n$relevantNodes := getRelevantNodes($newNodes, $activeNodes)\n\n$irrelevantNodes:= $activeNodes \\ $relevantNodes\n\nin\n\n$knowledgeGraph := $knowledgeGraph + $newNodes + $newConnections\n$activeNodes := $relevantNodes\n\npruneNodes($irrelevantNodes, {$CACHE})\n\n{($knowledgeGraph, $activeNodes)}","model_a":"claude-v1","model_b":"alpaca-13b"}

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers, 31\u201320. The game was played on February 2, 2020, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, which is the home of the Dolphins. This was the eleventh Super Bowl hosted by the South Florida region and the sixth Super Bowl hosted in Miami Gardens, which hosted Super Bowl XLIV ten years earlier.\n\nThis was the Chiefs' first Super Bowl victory since Super Bowl IV and their first NFL championship since joining the league in the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes led Kansas City to a 12\u20134 regular season record and the team's third Super Bowl appearance overall. With the emergence of quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, the 49ers finished the regular season with a 13\u20133 record and advanced to their seventh Super Bowl appearance overall.\n\nThe first half of the game was back and forth between both teams, with the game tied at 10 at halftime. In the third quarter, the 49ers began to pull away, with a Robbie Gould field goal and a touchdown run by Raheem Mostert giving them a 20\u201310 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, over the final 6:13 of the game, the Chiefs offense completed two touchdown drives with Mahomes throwing touchdown passes to Travis Kelce and Damien Williams, to take the lead just before the two-minute warning. The Chiefs then stopped the 49ers on defense, and a late touchdown run by Damien Williams, as well as a Kendall Fuller interception, sealed the victory and ended the Chiefs' 50-year championship drought as well as earning Andy Reid his first NFL championship as a head coach.[2] Mahomes was named Super Bowl MVP, having completed 26 of 42 pass attempts for 286 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, as well as rushing for 29 yards and one touchdown.[3]\n\nThe game's broadcast in the United States by Fox, along with the halftime show headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, was seen by an estimated 102 million viewers\u2014a slight increase over Super Bowl LIII in 2019 (which had seen the smallest audience for the game in 10 years). Due to the seating capacity of Hard Rock Stadium, this game also had the third lowest attendance in Super Bowl history (behind Super Bowl I and Super Bowl LV the following year).","model_a":"guanaco-33b","model_b":"fastchat-t5-3b"}

{"question_id":"cc977bc9f8104e73afc8d005f64ae222","prompt":"After revealing the government\u2019s lies about Vietnam, Ellsberg spent six decades as an anti-nuclear activist, getting arrested as many as ninety times in civil-disobedience protests. Give me a summary of the main points presented in this article entitled \"Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s Life Beyond the Pentagon Papers\" Daniel Ellsberg, who died on Friday, of pancreatic cancer, at age ninety-two, became the father of whistle-blowing in America when he leaked the Pentagon Papers to the Times, in 1971. In the course of several months in 1969 and 1970, he copied seven thousand pages of top-secret documents that laid out how four successive Presidents, from Truman to Johnson, deceived the public about U.S. policy in Vietnam. But, at the time, Ellsberg was also planning an even more audacious reveal. Another several thousand pages, which were never released to the public, detailed Washington\u2019s plans for an all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union and China. Ellsberg had been hired at rand Corporation, the Air Force-affiliated think tank headquartered in Los Angeles, in the throes of the Cold War, in 1959, and worked on an \u00e9lite team that helped formulate U.S. nuclear strategy and the command and control of its nuclear weapons. While interviewing officers at a remote American air base in the Pacific, Ellsberg made the unsettling discovery that commanders there had been empowered by President Eisenhower to launch nuclear missiles themselves if time or circumstances did not permit authorization by the President. His job involved regular consultations with the Pentagon, and, after John F. Kennedy was elected President, in 1960, Ellsberg quickly became a trusted rising star, working under Robert McNamara, Kennedy\u2019s Secretary of Defense. In the spring of 1961, when he was thirty, Ellsberg drafted the top-secret operational plans for general nuclear war issued by McNamara to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Soon after, Kennedy decided to seek out more detail on the effects of a nuclear war. He submitted a question, in writing, to the Joint Chiefs. The question was drafted by Ellsberg: \u201cIf your plans for general [nuclear war] are carried out as planned, how many people will be killed in the Soviet Union and China?\u2019\u2019 Ellsberg was shown the chiefs\u2019 answer in the form of a graph\u2014two hundred and seventy-five million would be killed initially, and fifty million more within six months, from injuries and fallout.

{"question_id":"9e21f888189842e5ad07baf9db698774","prompt":"Please rewrite this passage more concisely: Organic Chemistry is notoriously hard. When I went to University, I heard a lot of complaints about it from other students.  There were only a handful of classes like these that would wipe out a third or more of the class.  In one or more of my 1st or 2nd year engineering classes, the class average on a few exams were as low as 35% so they implemented a curve in order to not fail everyone, but to fail a set amount of students based on the curve.  I took the hit a couple of times and got kicked out of Engineering school. When I applied for an appeal, the department head brought up our eldest brother's name and essentially asked why I couldn't be more like him (I believe, our bro got accepted into masters degree program in Electrical Engineering).  So the point I'm making is that I had no idea that you went and started to take Organic Chemistry, so good on you for even getting that far!  I still don't know how you did it with doing that well with your classes. I only succeeded to that level with a computer programming class (with a language that I self-studied already) and another single class that I took by itself over the summer session. Everything else I couldn't learn at the pace and the method that the professor teaches. ","model_a":"gpt4all-13b-snoozy","model_b":"vicuna-13b"}

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have exhibited exciting progress in capabilities, capturing the interest of practitioners and the public alike. Yet, while the literature on the trustworthiness of GPT models remains limited, practitioners have proposed employing capable GPT models for sensitive applications to healthcare and finance - where mistakes can be costly. To this end, this work proposes a comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation for large language models with a focus on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, considering diverse perspectives - including toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution robustness, robustness on adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness. Based on our evaluations, we discover previously unpublished vulnerabilities to trustworthiness threats. For instance, we find that GPT models can be easily misled to generate toxic and biased outputs and leak private information in both training data and conversation history. We also find that although GPT-4 is usually more trustworthy than GPT-3.5 on standard benchmarks, GPT-4 is more vulnerable given jailbreaking system or user prompts, potentially due to the reason that GPT-4 follows the (misleading) instructions more precisely. Our work illustrates a comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation of GPT models and sheds light on the trustworthiness gaps.","model_a":"guanaco-33b","model_b":"gpt4all-13b-snoozy"}
