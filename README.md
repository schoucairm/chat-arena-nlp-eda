# Natural Langauge Processing with Chatbot Arena

Data source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/chatbot_arena_conversations

## Project Overview:

## Dataset Description:

## Project Goals: 

This project comprises two primary tasks:

**Task A:** Modeling the Winning Model 
- Predict which chatbot's response will win the user's vote, utilizing text features and embeddings.
  
**Task B:** Hardness Prediction 
- Assess and predict the difficulty of questions posed to the chatbots, translating into a discrete score from 1 to 10.

## Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  ### EDA Questions: 
  *What is the average win rate of each model (assuming uniform sampling and no ties)?* \
  *What are the distributions of prompt and response lengths?* \
  *How well does a model perform relative to other models?* \
  *Is there a relationship between variance in model performance and average hardness of prompts won?* \
  *Which topics are most commonly attributed to the prompts?* \
  *Is there a relationship between the average hardness score of each topic and the frequency of each topic?* \
  *Is there a relationship between number of topics (“topic modeling complexity”) and total hardness score?* \
  *Is there a relationship between length of prompt and hardness score?*
